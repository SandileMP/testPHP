					<p>You have been invited to participate in an e-interview. An e-interview is in all aspects the same as a
					traditional interview, except that you will not be interviewed by a person, but will be presented with
					a set of pre-selected questions and your interview will be recorded using your communication’s
					device webcam. Your recorded interview will then be available for review by the interview panel. </p>
					<p>It is very important that you prepare for this interview in the same way you would for a normal
					interview. The e-interview will be your first opportunity to impress a potential employer, so please
					be sure to consider the following when preparing for the e-interview:</p>
					<ul class="text-info">
						<li>Test your microphone and webcam before you start with the interview. Make sure you can
						clearly see yourself in the webcam and you can clearly hear yourself when listening to the
						test video.</li>
						<li>Dress up, as you will for a formal interview.</li>
						<li>Try to keep the webcam on a desk or table that does not move around to ensure the
						recording is constant and professional</li>
						<li>Do not do the e-interview in a public space where you might be disturbed or interrupted.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>We wish you all the luck with the e-interview. Please remember to test your webcam and
					microphone by clicking on the “Test My System” menu.</p>
